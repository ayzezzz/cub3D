The libft project involves creating a custom C library that includes essential functions from the standard C library, along with additional utility functions. This project focuses on deepening understanding of C programming concepts such as memory management, string manipulation, and data structures. By implementing functions like memset, strdup, and linked list operations, libft serves as a foundation for future projects, reinforcing skills in writing reusable and efficient code.
